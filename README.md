# Manugg_LimitPerUser
### Manugg_LimitPerUser is a Magento 1 extension with two main funcionalities:
1. Limit the quantity of a product that a single account can buy.
Sometimes shop owners want to launch special promotions where an exclusive item is available for users but they want to limit it to 2 items per account. 
It can also be useful if shop owners want to create products designed to get new registered users for the website since you force people to register a new account instead of using a friend's account.
2. Disable the use of the shopping cart for unregistered users. 
Disabling the use of the shopping cart for unregistered users we force the guests to register if they want to make a potential order.
