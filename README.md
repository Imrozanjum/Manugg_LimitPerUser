# Manugg_LimitPerUser
### Manugg_LimitPerUser is a Magento 1 extension with two main features:
1. Limit the quantity of a product that a single account can buy.
    * Users will not be able to buy a product beyond the limit that the shop owner sets up
    * This limit persist through different orders. This extension will make sure that the limit is in place even if there are different orders for the same product.
2. Disable the use of the shopping cart for unregistered users. 
    * Sometimes the shop owner wants to increase conversion rate and wants to motivate non-registered users to register as soon as they see a product they like. With this feature shop owners can encourage visitors to register since they need it to use the shopping cart.
